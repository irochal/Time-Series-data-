# Time-Series-data-
## Project 
For this project I was given a time series which is meant to represent monthly sales of a product over a ten-year period, from January 2011 to December 2020.
The aim of the project was to identify and fit a suitable time series model to the data. This model is to be used for forecasting and I produced a forecast
for the period January to June 2021. These forecasts were also assesed.
